## Peer to peer lending: Your own terms

68% of loans in the alternative lending market in Africa are peer-to-peer (P2P). With **Clixpesa P2P Lending**, users can **offer** or **request** loans on their own terms — setting amounts, durations, and interest — while Clixpesa Finance helps reduce risk by monitoring credit profiles and only recommending compatible matches.

### Why offer P2P loans on Clixpesa?

P2P lending on Clixpesa democratises access to credit and creates new income streams for users. Key benefits:

- **Lower cost of credit:** Direct lending between users cuts out intermediaries and reduces fees.
- **Flexible terms:** Lenders and borrowers set terms that suit their needs — short day loans, multi-week inventory loans, etc.
- **New earning opportunities:** Lenders earn interest on capital they’d otherwise hold idle.
- **Fast access:** Offers and requests are discoverable in the app so borrowers can access capital quickly.
- **Risk-aware matching:** Clixpesa recommends matches based on on-platform credit signals to reduce default risk.
- **Automated monitoring & enforcement:** Repayments are tracked and the platform follows up on missed payments.

### How it works

1. **Create an Offer (Lender):** A user creates a loan offer — specifying currency (e.g. cUSD), amount, interest, maximum duration and any limits (e.g. min/max KES).
2. **Browse Offers (Borrower):** Borrowers browse or filter offers, or see offers recommended for them based on their credit profile and needs.
3. **Request the Loan:** Borrower selects an offer and sends a request.
4. **Approve & Disburse:** Lender reviews the request and, if satisfied, approves and disburses funds to the borrower.
5. **Repayment & Tracking:** Clixpesa tracks scheduled repayments, shows repayment history in the app, and notifies both parties.
6. **Default Handling:** If a borrower misses repayments, Clixpesa follows up and enforces platform policies to reduce losses (notifications, collections workflow, and escalation where needed).

### Example (illustrative)

- **Offer:** Akimbo Keya — 300 cUSD
- **Interest:** 5% (approx repay 315 cUSD)
- **Duration:** 2–3 weeks
  This is the kind of concise offer a lender can create and a borrower can accept in a few taps.

### Who benefits?

- **Small business owners** needing short-term working capital (inventory, supplies).
- **Day-loan borrowers** who rely on fast, small credit lines to run trade.
- **Everyday savers & investors** looking to earn interest by lending directly.
- **Communities & groups** who want flexible peer lending outside traditional banks.

### How Clixpesa reduces risk

- **Credit scoring & monitoring:** We continuously monitor on-platform behaviour and external signals to build trustable credit profiles.
- **Smart recommendations:** Matches presented to users are filtered and ranked by risk compatibility.
- **Transparency & records:** Loan terms and repayment history are visible to both parties.
- **Operational follow-up:** Automated reminders and escalation reduce missed payments; platform policies handle disputes and defaults.

### Our vision

We want to make lending fairer, faster, and more accessible by letting people lend to — and borrow from — each other under clear, controllable terms. By combining user control with smart monitoring and built-in enforcement, Clixpesa opens affordable credit to more people while offering new ways to earn.
